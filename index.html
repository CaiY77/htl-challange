1. Write HTML/CSS to draw the following scene (inline css is fine if you want):
  a. One red box, 200x200 pixels
  b. One blue box, 200x200 pixels
  c. One green box, 100x100 pixels
  d. The green box should be centered inside the red box
  e. The red and blue boxes should not overlap

<img src=”http://hashtag­analytics.com/12345/pixel.gif” width=”1” height=”1”/>
<!-- 2. You have started an analytics company with the domain “hashtag­analytics.com”. You
provide this tracking pixel for your customers to place on their websites. By summing the
number of times the pixel was loaded, you calculate the number of visitors to each site.
<img src=”http://hashtag­analytics.com/12345/pixel.gif” width=”1” height=”1”/>
As it stands, this pixel has a problem because it will be cached by the browser.
a. Why is caching a problem for the analytics company?

- caching will only store information in the catch on the user side.

b. How could you prevent browser caching? (use any technique(s) you want)

- Most if not all browers wether it's internet explorer or firefox allow users to alter settings so that when they reach the given page,
you can always fetch for newest version of the page

c. What will happen if the customer’s website is served over HTTPS? How could you
modify the tracking pixel to fix that?


d. List some information the tracking company could collect (ex: IP address)


e. List some additional information (if any) that could be collected if a <script> tag is used
instead of an <img> tag. -->

// 3. Harder!
// The following image tag appears somewhere on some webpage. The rest of the page is valid
// HTML, but otherwise unknown.
// <img id=”myimage” src=”http://hashtag­analytics.com/myimage.jpg” width=”300” height=”250”/>
// Write CODE in plain javascript to do the following (jQuery is fine too, if you prefer):
// Every 2 seconds:
// ­ Check whether the image is viewable**
// ­ If yes, write “visible” to the console (that is, window.console)
// ­ If no, do nothing
myImage = document.getElementById('myimage').
visible = myImage.checkValidity();

setInterval(()=>{
  (visible)
  ? window.console("visible")
  : null
},2000)
